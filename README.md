# Airline_Propensity_of_buying_tickets
An aviation company that provides domestic as well as international trips to the customers now wants to apply a targeted approach instead of reaching out to each of the customers. This time they want to do it digitally instead of tele calling. Hence, they have collaborated with a social networking platform, so they can learn the digital and social behaviour of the customers and provide the digital advertisement on the user page of the targeted customers who have a high propensity to take up the product. Propensity of buying tickets is different for different login devices. Hence, you have to create 2 models separately for Laptop and Mobile. [Anything which is not a laptop can be considered as mobile phone usage.] The advertisements on the digital platform are a bit expensive; hence, you need to be very accurate while creating the models.
